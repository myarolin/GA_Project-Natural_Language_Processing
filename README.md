# Natural Language Processing with Reddit

This project uses natural language processing and creates a classification model based on posts from numerous programming-focused subreddits on reddit.com. 

Project completed as a student in the Data Science Immersive program at General Assembly.

### Techniques/Models Used:
-	Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
-	NLTK (stopwords, PorterStemmer)
-	Sklearn (CountVectorizer, Tfidf vectorizer, LatentDirichletAllocation, Truncated SVD, RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier, StandardScaler)

### Data source: 
The dataset consists of posts that were web scraped from various programming-focused subreddits on reddit.com in December 2016. The dataset contains 26,688 rows and 53 columns.
